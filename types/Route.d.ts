 * wildcard values will be provided to the `component` as props.
 * They can also be accessed inside a `Route` slot via `let:params`.
 *
 * The `Route` `component` will also receive the current `location`, as well as
 * the `navigate` function, that is scoped to the current `Route` as props.
 * They can be accessed inside the `Route` slot, via `let:location` and
